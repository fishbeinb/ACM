Sequencer following Conway's Game of Life

CGOL - Sequence which follows CGOL's officiall rules.
CGOL_2LIVES - Simple modification to the rules. Each square now has 2 Lives. Much better for interesting visualization.
CGOL_KS - Many new features added, CGOL_2LIVES rules, interface should be cleaned up or labled. (KS stands for Kitchen Sink)
